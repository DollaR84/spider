# spider
Spider card game on pygame

This is an implementation of the classic spider solitaire.
The goal of the game is to discard all cards in a specific order.
The order of assembly is from Ace and then to increase the value of the card to the king.
It is allowed to move cards from column to column. Cards are moved according to the following rules:
• you can move the top card of any column to an empty space;
• the top card of the column can be moved to the next card in seniority, regardless of its suit and color;
• a stack of cards of the same suit, lying in order, can be moved as one card;
It is allowed at any time when there are no empty columns to discard cards from the deck, one for each row.
Several modes are available.
It is possible to switch decks:
• 36 cards;
• 52 cards;
3 difficulty levels are also available:
• one suit;
• 2 suits;
• 4 suits;
Maps were drawn using SVG vector graphics.
Full keyboard control minimized keys.
All control keys can be found in the game itself or in readme files.
